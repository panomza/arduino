# AP12R1 FACELIFT PROJECT

# Situation:
The presence of dust in environments are unavoidable. In fact, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, indoor air can be 2 to 5 times more polluted than outdoor air. This airborne pollution contributes to minor annoyances such as itchy eyes, sneezing, and headaches to human beings. Worst still, it can be a major contributing factor to severe allergies, life-threatening asthma.

To solve this problem we have the current Facelift air purifier product which is working well to address this issue. But, we would like to leverage the advantage of IoT to make the air purifier smarter.
 
# Proposed Solution: 
We would like to implement a “Microcontroller” and "Air monitoring sensor” to monitor the air quality and operate if the presence of dust or hazardous gas reach a certain level of awareness, this could save a lot of electricity! And the operational status will be available online that we can access everywhere.

# Steps Involved: 
1. Hardware design
2. Software component design
3. Make development sample
4. Product Verification
